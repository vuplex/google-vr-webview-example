# Google VR WebView Example

This Unity project demonstrates how to use the [Vuplex 3D WebView plugin](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) with Cardboard and Daydream. It includes the [GVR Unity SDK](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk), so the only thing you must import is the 3D WebView plugin for [Android](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-android-137030) or [iOS](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-ios-137040) ([or both](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-android-and-ios-135383)).
